---What's doing this script ?---

It's more easy to send requests about Lock, Downlock, Closure, Openning, and Validation of changes
The requests are sent to a webhook to Slack or Discord
The requests can be sent to a GForm too (currently only with the sames fields we have in BeLux)
Thanks to that and to Bertzzz's , we've got a spreadsheet that helps to promotion decision on L1-L3 levels

---What's New---
This script now supports States, and i've added the USA NewYork, New Jersay, ...

---What does it looks like ?---
 
The Validation link is on top of the Left collumn just above the settings tab

The Lock and Downlock links are below the locking choice in the général tab

The Closure and Open links are ...? In the Closure Tab just above the Closure tab.
   Just one thing, this part only shows if the closure layer is set

---How can i use it ?---

Like most of the scripts used by Waze editors, you need to install 
A browser, but beeing here, i assume that's already the case...(Not Internet explorer or Edge)
Tampermonkey extention
The script itself... 
https://gitlab.com/WMEScripts/wme-send-to-slack-public/raw/master/WME-send-to-slack.user.js

---What's different whith the old one ?---

I've : 
- rewrited completely the script
- fixed some of the bugs
- moved the icons
- added a setting tab when a venue, segment, camera, JB, ... is selected
- added the ability to add more Countries on Slack/Discord
- updated the GForm submition
- the script source code is now in clear text except for one dependency

So now, If you want to add a Country/Community, if you're using Slack or Discord, just tell me...
If you just want to add other supports(other than Discord or Slack), let me know which, and i'll search to use it.

---How to send bugs or features ?---

Just :
go on this page (you'll need to create an account) : https://gitlab.com/WMEScripts/wme-send-to-slack-public/issues
or send it by mail at incoming+wmescripts-wme-send-to-slack-public-14393158-issue-@incoming.gitlab.com
The mail does not work with every mailbox

See you later for New things...
