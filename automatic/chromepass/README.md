ChromePass is a small password recovery tool that allows you to view the user names 
and passwords stored by Google Chrome Web browser.

For each password entry, the following information is displayed: Origin URL, Action 
URL, User Name Field, Password Field, User Name, Password, and Created Time.

You can select one or more items and then save them into text/html/xml file or copy 
them to the clipboard.
