    <summary>Utility to completely remove system drivers</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[
Display Driver Uninstaller is a driver removal utility that can help you completely 
remove Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) display card drivers and packages (AMD/NVIDIA) 
from your system without leaving leftovers behind; including registry keys, folders 
and files, services, and the driver store.

The AMD/NVIDIA video drivers can normally be uninstalled from the Windows Control 
panel, this driver uninstaller program was designed to be used in cases where the 
standard driver uninstall fails, or whenever you need to thoroughly delete NVIDIA 
and ATI video card drivers.

The current effect after you use this driver removal will be similar as if its the 
first time you install a new driver just like a fresh, clean install of Windows. 
As with any tool of this kind, we recommend creating a new system restore point 
before using it, so that you can revert your system at any time if you run into 
problems.

#### Usage
* The tool can be used in Normal mode but for absolute stability when using DDU, Safe 
Mode is always recommended.
* Make a backup or a system restore. (but it should normally be pretty safe.)
