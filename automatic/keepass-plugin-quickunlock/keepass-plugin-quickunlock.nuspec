    <summary>Plugin for KeePass 2.x to quickly unlock an open database</summary>
    <description>KeePassQuickUnlock is a plug-in for KeePass 2.x which lets you re-open your database without your full password. If you want to re-open your database, you can type just a few characters (by default, the first 3 characters of your password) to unlock quickly and easily! If the wrong QuickUnlock key is entered, the database keeps locked and the full password is required to re-open.

This plugin doesn't change the way how KeePass encrypts your database so your passwords are still safe. For more informations why this plugin doesn't break safety, read http://keepass.info/help/base/security.html#secspecattacks
