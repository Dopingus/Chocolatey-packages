ChromeHistoryView is a small utility that reads the history data file of Google Chrome 
Web browser, and displays the list of all visited Web pages in the last days. For each 
visited Web page, the following information is displayed:

URL, Title, Visit Date/Time, Number of visits, number of times that the user typed this 
address (Typed Count), Referrer, and Visit ID. 

You can select one or more history items, and them export them into html/xml/csv/text 
file, or copy the information to the clipboard and paste it into Excel.
